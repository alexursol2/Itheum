# TKYC Website 

## Where can I find the site?

We currently have a [development site](https://tkyc-frontend.onrender.com/). We set it up to allow everyone to check the project without the technical knowledge to build it.

# Development guide
## How to start the website locally?

First, install the required modules,
```
